"Beautiful watch face. The band looks nice all around. The links do make that squeaky cheapo noise when you swing it back and forth on your wrist which can be embarrassing in front of watch enthusiasts. However, to the naked eye from afar, you can't tell the links are cheap or folded because it is well polished and brushed and the folds are pretty tight for the most part. love the new member of my collection and it looks great. I've had it for about a week and so far it has kept good time despite day 1 which is typical of a new mechanical watch.","Subject: Thank You for Your Feedback!
